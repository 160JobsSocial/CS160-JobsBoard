WSClient provides an interface to consume external web services. It focuses on
integrating web service operations as Rules actions, but can also be used as data
provider for other modules. It also offers a convenient API for developers to
quickly invoke web services.

WSClient ships with two sub-modules that support SOAP and REST endpoints.
